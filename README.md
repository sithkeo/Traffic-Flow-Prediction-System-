# Traffic-Flow-Prediction-System - Assignment 2B
The Part B of Assignment 2 (2B) requires you to work with your group to implement ML algorithms to train ML models for traffic prediction and integrate the traffic predictor with Part A to develop a fully functioned TBRGS.

# Overview 
This Project provides lengthy Python Implementation alongside Jupyter NoteBook, to showcase basic, deep learning techniques, data parsing & machine langugage algorithms + training & testing with provided datasets
It includes a Travel Time Estimation based on each edge of the map from the isolated Boroondara area.

# Features
1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
2. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
3. (The) Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)
